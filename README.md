# Variant_Disease_Webapp_Project
This is my final project for Databases for Bioinfomatics course. The web app has 3 tables with clickable links to explore variant, disease, and gene data. The tables are searchable and headers allow for sorting. Each search workes for a differnt database.

all.html is the html code and what you click to open the web app
all_databses.js is the java script of html code, this has all requests to get the databases from couchdb
the various .json.gz files are compressed json databases that I had on couchdb 
style.css has color and font info for the webapp
